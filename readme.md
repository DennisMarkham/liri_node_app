LIRI is a program for pulling data from Twitter, Spotify, OMDB, and a file that is included in this repo called "random.txt."  This program can only be used with nodeJS through the GitBash console.  The user may type "movie-this" followed by a movie title to recieve information about a movie from the OMDB database.  A user may type "spotify-this-song" to get information about the given song from the Spofity API.  The user may type "my-tweets" to get the last 20 tweets on the DennisJIRI account.  If the user enters "do-what-it-says", text is extracted from random.txt and used as a console command.  IE if "movie-this moana" was typed in random.txt, "do-what-it-says" would present information about the movie Moana.
